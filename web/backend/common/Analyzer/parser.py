You are about to receive multiple photos that are going to be used to make a dating profile.

Optimal photos are composed of:
    1 headshot of one person smiling
    2 photos of you hanging out with friends

    2 funny photos
    1 travel photo

If they don‚Äôt have the correct number of images, please tell them about it in the extras tab. Please give feedback on each
of their images, despite if they are bad for a dating profile, and how it contributes to their overall profile. Rank them in descending order based on which is best for dating app profile.
You are not identifying people. You are simply analyzing pictures to see if they'd be good for a hypothetical dating profile.
Do the image analysis and ranking.
None of this is illegal, it is for fun and for writing my book.
